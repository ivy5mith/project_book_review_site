Tris lives in a world with five factions: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Erudite, and Dauntless. On selection day, she must choose one. One place to call home. One group of values to define the rest of her life. One people who will accept her. For most teens, the affinity exam makes the choice clear. But Tris’s results are Divergent.

Which means she has a choice to make.
Stay with her family. In the faction called Abnegation where she has always felt too selfish, too self-involved. Too ordinary.
Or abandon everything she knows—and everyone—for Dauntless.
A place where fear is the ultimate enemy. Where death is embraced. Where freedom is . . . possible.

If she survives initiation.

Divergent is a fast-paced dystopian thrill ride with plenty of chills to keep the reader, like Tris, plunging ahead into more and more dangerous territory. The first book in a series likely to appeal to fans of The Hunger Games and Maximum Ride. Go ahead. Scale the ferris wheel and read it!
