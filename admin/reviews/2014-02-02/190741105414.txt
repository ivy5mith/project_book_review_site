<p>My experience with <em>Under the Never Sky</em> was sort of funny, because I knew nothing about the book when I bought it at Barnes and Nobles. I&#8217;ve heard about that book, and I knew that people LOVED it (and Perry!), but I really just had no clue what it was about. When I was in B&amp;N, I decided that I was not in a dystopian kind of mood. The thought brought me down. I just wanted something paranormal. When I was browsing through the new YA section, I ran across the second book in the series, <em>Through the Evernight</em>. Again, I knew nothing about this series. Honestly, the second book looks like a paranormal book. I didn&#8217;t even consider reading the back of it, because I&#8217;d heard such great things and it was OBVIOUSLY a paranormal book cover. Uhm. No. I was wrong. It ended up being a dystopian book!</p>
<p>I wish that I could join the crowd and say how much I loved <em>Under the Never Sky. </em>I want to be one of those girls who gushes over how awesome and hot and spectacular Perry is! I wish that I was gaga over Aria and Perry and craving the next book. Now, I didn&#8217;t DISlike <em>Under the Never Sky. </em>There really was nothing THAT wrong with it. Here comes the but&#8230;..I found it boring. I didn&#8217;t care for any of the characters. I wasn&#8217;t fascinated with the world that Rossi created. I wasn&#8217;t even blown away by a single scene. I was just bored. I don&#8217;t know if this happened because I was in such a dystopian funk. I really didn&#8217;t want to read a dystopian book. It actually got to the point that I set <em>Under the Never Sky </em>down around halfway through it and picked up <em>Burn Bright </em>by Bethany Frenette. I just wanted something paranormal. When I eventually went back to <em>Under the Never Sky, </em>it didn&#8217;t get any better for me. I stayed bored throughout the entire thing. It got to the point that I just skimmed probably the last 25% of the book. I had read it consistently up till then, but by that point, I just didn&#8217;t care what happened anymore.</p>
<p>The thing that bugged me most about this book was how unrealistic everything was. Now, I know that dystopian is supposed to be unrealistic, but that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m talking about. First complaint: some things made absolutely no sense! How did Perry get into Aria&#8217;s world in the beginning of the book? They unlocked a door to let themselves out. How did that let Perry in? And how did Perry miraculously run across Aria when she was dumped off in the desert? Because he&#8217;s really just going to stumble on her and know who she is RIGHT. AWAY. Not. No. Also, Aria and Perry HATED each other. I mean&#8230;they didn&#8217;t have a single cell in their bodies that liked each other. Normally that&#8217;s fine, because there&#8217;s a progression of feelings over time. Not in this book. It literally went from them hating each other all throughout the book. And then BAM! A page turned and all of a sudden Perry had feelings for Aria. A few chapters later, Aria had feelings for Perry. WHAT?! No. That just doesn&#8217;t work for me.</p>
<p>Veronica Rossi&#8217;s writing is very beautiful and smooth. There was a lot of detail&#8230;.probably too much for my personal taste. She&#8217;s obviously a great writer. Unfortunately, this book just didn&#8217;t rock my boat. It was okay. It wasn&#8217;t bad by any means. But&#8230;.I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be reading the second one. I barely even know how the first one ended, because I just didn&#8217;t care. I think that a lot of dystopian lovers are going to enjoy <em>Under the Never Sky, </em>and I would encourage everyone to read it based on how popular it is right now. It sucks that it wasn&#8217;t for me, but I gave it a shot!</p>
