<p>Pyromania: A mental derangement, excitement or excessive enthusiasm for fire.<br />
Having celebrity parents isn’t as hot as it sounds. Yes, there’s money to burn, fame and some totally smoking guys&#8230;But when your dad’s more interested in blazing a trail to the top of the charts than why you got kicked out of school, again, it can make you seriously angry. And if there’s one thing Ember knows, it’s that the smallest spark of anger can ignite a whole heap of trouble&#8230;</p>
<p>Ember has the whole teen angst thing going for her. You see, her mother died a little while ago and her father … well, he’s never around much. He’s famous and so is his new wife – Ember’s step mother – and they both live in L.A. Ember doesn’t. Ember lives in London. At a boarding school. Until she gets kicked out. Why did she get kicked out? Well, they don’t call her Ember for no reason…</p>
<p>So she’s shipped to the US for the summer and embarks on a unintentional journey of self discovery. And what better way to help you learn more about yourself than a summer fling. This is a summer fling with a twist, though, and readers should prepare themselves for a nasty twist. Nothing is as it seems and Ember is about to learn the biggest lesson so far. Is a loved-up resolution imminent? Maybe, maybe not. That’s something you’ll need to read and figure out for yourself.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ember Fury</strong></em> has something going for it that not a lot of other young adult releases do: it’s a mash of prose and pictures, coupled together to tell the story. Like comics or graphic novels? Then I reckon you’re going to love this book. While not strictly a graphic novel, Ember Fury is what I like to call an illustrated novel. The pictures don’t tell the story, but they certainly add a new dimension to the way the characters are perceived, while adding humor and a light-heartedness to all the drama. The illustrations are outstanding, and without them, this novel wouldn&#8217;t stand as tall as it does.</p>
<p>Will Ember’s journey take her to a place of good, or will it push her back into a deeper pit of darkness? Get ready for a roller-coaster ride of troubled teen angst at its best.</p>
<p>While the story is a little on the predictable side, the whole concept of the novel isn’t. I reckon that this one is going to be interesting enough that readers will want to check it out – and you should. It’s definitely worth a look in.</p>
